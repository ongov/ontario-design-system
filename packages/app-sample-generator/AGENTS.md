## Commit Guidelines

- When generating commits, use the Conventional Commits spec.
- Ensure commit messages are clear and descriptive of the changes made.
- Write commit messages in the imperative mood (e.g., "fix bug" instead of "fixed bug" or "fixes bug").
- Include body text in commit messages to outline the reasoning behind the changes being committed.

## Tips

- Remember to update the readme or documentation if your changes affect usage or functionality.

## Canadian English Spelling

Documentation, code comments, commit messages, and variable names should use Canadian English spelling where natural in prose:

- colour
- centre
- licence (noun)
- organise
- behaviour
- favour

Code identifiers should still respect platform and ecosystem conventions:

- CSS uses `color`, `center`.
- Web APIs and libraries are not renamed.

When in doubt, follow the existing local patterns in the file you are editing.
